This is a git repo

steps i followed:

step1-first i installed git and configured it using the following commands:
      sudo apt-get install git
      git config --global user.name "user_name"
      git config --global user.email "email_id"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step2-Creating a local repository-then i created a local repository equivalent to which i have to create a new repository by logging into my github account
(note:both repositories must have the same name)
commands used were-
      git init Mytest  this command  initializes that newly created folder as a git folder.
      cd Mytest      (Change the directory to this newly created folder)

step3-Creating a README file to describe the repository-then i created and added a readme file to the local repository using the command-
      gedit README
step4-Creating a repository on GitHub by the same name.Once this is created, we can push the contents of the local repository onto the GitHub repository in your profile. But before we can do that we first have to-Connect our local repository to the newly created repository on GitHub using the command:

       git remote add origin https://github.com/user_name/Mytest.git
       
where https://github.com/user_name/Mytest.git is the url of the newly created repository on github.

step5-Pulling files from GitHub to our local repository: in order to do this we use the command-
      git pull origin master.
                                                     0R
step5- Pushing files in local repository to GitHub repository-follow the following steps
       step a)adding files to be pushed:git add README
       step b)commiting and adding commit message i.e conforming added files to be pushed:
              Once all the files are added, we can commit it. This means that we have finalized what additions and/or changes have to be made and they are now ready to be uploaded to our repository. Use the command :git commit -m "some_message"

step6-Pushing files in local repository to GitHub repository:
      git push origin master
      Enter the login credentials [user_name and password] .
